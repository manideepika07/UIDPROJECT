This portfolio, accessible at https://manideepika07.github.io/UIDPROJECT/, is a personal project designed to showcase my skills, experiences, and achievements as a web developer. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong emphasis on clean UI design and responsive layout. The home page features a hero section with a brief introduction and navigation links to other sections such as About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact. The About Me section presents my background and education in a visually engaging way, while the Projects section highlights some of my key work using neatly designed project cards. The Skills section categorizes my technical abilities with icons for quick reference. The Contact section includes a simple form and social media links to make it easy for visitors to reach out. Throughout the design, I followed principles of simplicity, consistency, and accessibility, ensuring the layout adapts well to various screen sizes through the use of Flexbox and media queries. The overall goal was to create a portfolio that is both functional and visually appealing, reflecting my attention to detail and passion for front-end development
